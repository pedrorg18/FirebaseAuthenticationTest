# FirebaseAuthenticationTest
App that signs a user in anonymously

First we import firebase into the project. CAUTION: the google json file is misssing and therefore the project won't work. You must create a firebase project and generate that file. Place it under the 'app' directory.

Then we add the authentication library, and a simple UI to sign in a user anonymously.
